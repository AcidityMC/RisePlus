# Rise+ (v6.0.0)
RisePlus (Rise+) is an free and open source Minecraft hacked client, mainly for 1.8 servers. It is based off of a EXTREMELY old build of Rise (from 3 or more years ago).

## Notice
If you are a Rise client developer, and would like me to take this down, contact me on Discord in my direct messages (te1amon).

This project uses code from a Rise developer build. The code used is not from the latest version, and is extremely outdated.

## Contributing
The goal of this project is to make a good looking, highly configurable, and overall good client.

If you wouls like to contribute, open issues or pull requests. These would be greatly appreciated!
